# Enchanted-Forest---Memory-Game
The Enchanted Forest is in peril! The mischievous spirits have scattered the fairies and unicorns across the forest, leaving them vulnerable to the Dark Sorcererâ€™s grasp. Your mission is to help reunite these magical creatures before the evil Sorcerer finds them. Match the pairs to restore their magic and save the forest from falling into darkness.

As part of the Becode training, I created this game for my daughter (5yo). I choose to create this type of game because it's one of my daughters favorites. 
Whit this in minde, I wanted to make something that she will definetly enjoy playing.
This will be her first online-game and it's a special one as it is also one of my first games I build.
